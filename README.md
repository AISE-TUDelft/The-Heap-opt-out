# The Heap Opt-Out
In order to opt-out of having your code included in the heap, please open an issue using the template given in the template.md file, or [click here](https://github.com/AISE-TUDelft/The-Heap-opt-out/issues/new?template=the-heap-opt-out.md).
Please open an issue with the account that is the owner of the code, in order for us to ensure that only the owners of the code are able to opt out.


We will remove all opt-out requests from future iterations of the heap.
